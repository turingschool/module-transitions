# Module Transitions

This repository consists of a set of files that outline the expectations that the instructors for each module have about the skills taught in the prior module.

## Goals

- Identify skills are not being covered in one module because the instructors expect that they've been covered in the previous moduleâ€”but aren't being covered their either.
- Identify skills that are being taught as if they were new concepts in both modules. These skills should be reviewed or built upon, not re-covered from the ground up.

## Action Steps

- Review these documents once a module.
- Update these documents whenever we come across a concept where we expected students to already have an understanding of it from the previous module and they don't.
